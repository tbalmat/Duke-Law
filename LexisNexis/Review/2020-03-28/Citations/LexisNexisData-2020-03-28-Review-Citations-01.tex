\maketitle

To date, two primary data sets have been received from LexisNexis (LN):  set A (3/13/2019) and set B (12/3/2019).  Citations were received with data set A only.  When asked whether additional or revised citations would be included with data set B, LN stated that no changes were made to the citations file as a result of the extract definition of data set B.  The following summarizes the citation file and several comparisons made between citations related to cases appearing in data sets A and B.

\section{Citation file contents}

Citations were supplied in a comma separated (CSV) file with each record having the intended format:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item Column 1:  Citing LNI
    \item Column 2:  Cited LNI
    \item Column 3:  Citation
    \item Column 4: Shepardâ€™s treatment
\end{itemize}

Example records with valid format appear in table \ref{tab:exCitationValid}.  133 records have citation entries that  contain one or more commas which, in a CSV context, cause additional columns to be inferred during import and generate an error.  Example records with commas in the citation field appear in table \ref{tab:exCitationInValid}.  Some  records have commas surrounded by double quotes, as in the final record of table \ref{tab:exCitationInValid}.  To correct erroneously formatted citation records prior to import into the project SQL database, double quotes were replaced with an exclamation point and each citation entry was delimited by double quotes.  With this format, commas within fields are treated as text and not field delimiters, giving records a valid CSV format.

\section{Evaluation of citing and cited LNI}

LNIs are formatted strings that uniquely identify citing and cited cases.  A valid LNI is composed of six dash-separated fields.  Individual field formats are listed in table \ref{tab:LNIField}.  An example, valid, LNI is 45CC-WT50-FM72-200M-00000-04.\\

Observations:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item All citing and cited LNIs are properly formatted as required by the patterns in table \ref{tab:LNIField}
    \item A total of 3,731,213 citations are recorded in the supplied citations file
    \item 325,307 unique citing LNIs are recorded.  Of these:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item 340,508 appear in case header records of data set A  
      \item 352,282 appear in case header records of data set B
    \end{itemize}  
    \item 327,330 unique LNIs are cited.  Of these:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item 176,493 appear in case header records of data set A  
      \item 179,333 appear in case header records of data set B

\section{Distribution of citations per citing case}

Figure \ref{fig:distCitationsPerCase} shows the distribution of the number of cited cases per citing case.  There exist 352,207 unique citing LNIs in the citations file.  Of these, 340,508 appear in case records of data set A, while 352,282 occur in case records of data set B.  Citing cases used in figure \ref{fig:distCitationsPerCase} are limited to those with an LNI appearing in case header records.  In the plot, symbol x indicates observation frequencies from data set A and symbol o indicates those from data set B.

\section{Citations with LNI that do not appear in case header records}

11,799 and 25 citing LNIs in data sets A and B, respectively, do not appear in case header records of the respective data set.  Although this is unexpected, it merely results in having citations that do not have a reference in the data.  However, 147,202 and 147,995 cited LNIs in data sets A and B, respectively, do not appear in case records of the corresponding data set.  In a relational database setting, these are termed "orphaned records" since there is a reference to a case by ID, but nothing is known about that case.  Information beyond the fact that a citation exists, such as the court, date of decision, case type, outcome, or panel, then the existence of orphaned citations seems problematic.\\

No citations were received with data set B.  When asked if we would receive revised citations, LN explained that changes to the scripts that generated case files for data set B did not affect citations.  Cases were included in data set B that do not appear in data set A (particularly for years 1973 and 2015-2018).  Is it likely that the additional cases are neither citing nor cited cases?

\section{Duplication of citations by reporter} 

Many citations are duplicated, having multiple reporters.  For instance, case 3RFG-6SY0-0038-X00H-00000-00 cites case 3S42-KX20-00B1-D24P-00000-00 on five separate records, one for each of reporters

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item Ct. App. 2nd Dkt. No. 96-1712
    \item 97-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) P50608
    \item 80 A.F.T.R.2d (RIA) 97-6085
    \item 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 21273
    \item 122 F.3d 112
\end{itemize}

Each of the above citations references Shepard's treatment letter f.  Care must be taken when aggregating cases by citation to make sure that actual citations, and not reported citations, are counted.  Additional information on reporters is available at \url{https://nyulaw.libguides.com/c.php?g=773843\&p=5551618}.  Following are excerpts from this site:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
  \item Federal case law will be divided between three branches: U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Courts of Appeal (Circuit Courts), and the U.S. District Courts. 
  \item  Case law is published in official and unofficial case law reporters, in chronological order. Supreme Court opinions are the only federal opinions published in official case reporters.  West is the major publisher of unofficial case reporters.
  \item Case citations are the easiest way to retrieve a case (it is possible to find cases by party name, but may not be  as exact).  Case citations are structured by volume number, reporter abbreviation, and first page of the case. 
  \item U.S Supreme Court Cases: Supreme Court opinions are published in 3 different case law reporters:
  United States Reports (the official reporter) - ``U.S.", Supreme Court Reporter (West) - ``S. Ct.",
  and Lawyers' Edition (Lexis) - ``L. Ed.".  Sample citation for Brown v. Board of Ed. of Topeka:
  347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873.
  \item  Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal: Circuit Court opinions are published in unofficial reporters (West):
  Federal Reporter - ``F.", Federal Reporter Second Series - ``F.2d" and Federal Reporter Third Series - ``F.3d".
  \item Federal District (Trial) Courts:  The District Court opinions are published in unofficial case reporters (West):
  Federal Supplement - ``F. Supp." and Federal Supplement Second Series - ``F. Supp.2d"
  \item Earlier Federal Cases (dating before the Federal Reporter series) are available in Federal Case ``F. Cas." bound
  volumes

\section{Distribution of the difference in number of citations by Shepard's treatment letter}

Figure \ref{fig:DifferenceInCasesByShepardLetter} shows the difference, between data sets B and A, in citations by Shepard's treatment.  Citing cases are limited to those that appear in case header records.  Figure \ref{fig:DifferenceInCasesShepardLetterByYear} plots the difference, between data sets B and A, in citation frequency by Shepard's letter and year.  Letters are limited to those with a total difference greater than 1,000 between data sets.  Red indicates a negative difference.
