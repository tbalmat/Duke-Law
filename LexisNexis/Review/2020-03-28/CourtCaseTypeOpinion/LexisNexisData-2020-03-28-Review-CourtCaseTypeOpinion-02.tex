\section{Evaluation of LNI}

LNIs are formatted strings that uniquely identify a decision record.  A valid LNI is composed of six dash-separated fields.  Individual field formats are listed in table \ref{tab:LNIField}.  An example, valid, LNI is 45CC-WT50-FM72-200M-00000-04.\\

Observations:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
  \item All LNIs in case records of data sets A and B consist of 28 characters, as required by the above pattern
  \item All LNIs in case records of data sets A and B are properly formatted
  \item Due to the appearance of extraneous text (opinion text) in the opinion-by field of set A, two cases were excluded from import into the March SQL databases (from which queries are executed).  These cases are (LNI) 3T3Y-TS60-0038-X1MJ-00000-00 and 3T8C-CSW0-0038-X3XN-00000-00.  The number of LNIs appearing in the March SQL database equals the number appearing in the source set A, after exclusion of the LNIs stated here (n=1,083,600).
  \item Case records for LNIs 3T3Y-TS60-0038-X1MJ-00000-00 and 3T8C-CSW0-0038-X3XN-00000-00 also appeared in set B and also had extraneous text in their opinion-by fields.  These records and ten additional records that duplicated LNI 3S4X-1450-003B-G54N-00000-00 were excluded from import into the December SQL database.  The number of LNIs appearing in the December SQL database equals the number appearing in the source set B, after exclusion of the LNIs stated here (n=1,124,500).

\section{Evaluation of decision date}

Valid decision dates in the source data have format yyyy-mm-dd, with the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item yyyy $\in$ \{1973 ... 2018\}
    \item mm $\in$ \{01 ... 12\}
    \item dd $\in$ \{01 ... 31\} when mm $\in$ \{01, 03, 05, 07, 08, 10, 12\}
    \item dd $\in$ \{01 ... 30\} when mm $\in$ \{04, 06, 09, 11\}
    \item dd $\in$ \{01 ... 29\} when mm=02 and yyyy is a leap year
    \item dd $\in$ \{01 ... 28\} when mm=02 and yyyy is not a leap year
\end{itemize}

\vspace{6pt}

Table \ref{tab:invalidDate} lists LNIs for cases with an invalid decision date (dates are missing).  Note that cases for LNIs appearing in table \ref{tab:invalidDate} do not appear in data set B.  All decision dates in data set B are valid.  Data set A records for listed LNIs are also missing a court name and case title.

\section{Distribution of cases by court and year}

Figure \ref{fig:distCasesCourtYear} shows the distribution of cases by court and year.  A difference in case frequency between data sets A and B is apparent, primarily, in early and late years for which additional observations were included in data set B.  Figure \ref{fig:diffCasesCourtYear} plots the difference in cases between data sets B and A by court and year.  Red points indicate a negative difference, black indicates a positive difference.

\section{Comparison of data set A and Set B case titles}

617 of 1,083,552 cases appearing in both data sets A and B have different short case names between data sets.  Table \ref{tab:diffShortName} lists a sample of such cases, along with short names as they appear in source records.  Most involve a difference in spelling of abbreviations or expansion of personal and organizational titles.  Although differences presented may seem merely semantic, a question arises as to what caused the change in LN's records or extraction procedure between data releases.  Eleven cases appearing in both data sets A and B have different long case names between data sets.  They are listed in table \ref{tab:diffLongName}.  Most differences in long case names appear to be due to changes of plaintiff or defendant names (Berman instead of Herman), correction of typographic errors (fulfillment instead of fullfilment), and alternate placement of plaintiff and defendant (Texas Pig Stands v. Hard Rock Cafe instead of Hard Rock Cafe v. Texas Pig Stands).  One results from removal of special characters appearing in the title in one set (``$<$" and ``$>$" in Charter Communications Investments v. Charter Communications).

\section{Evaluation of opinion, concurring, and dissenting authors}\label{sec:evalOpAuthor}

Opinion, concurring, and dissenting author fields in the source data contain a combination of LN assigned judge IDs and textual names.  Table \ref{tab:exampleOpinionJudge} contains example author entries.  Table \ref{tab:distOpinionType} lists the distribution of cases by all combinations of opinion, concurring, and dissenting author existence.\\

Observations (in both data sets):

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item No single, consistent method is used to identify authoring judges
    \item Approximately 68\% of cases have no opinion, concurring, or dissenting authors recorded
    \item Approximately 28\% of cases have opinion, but no concurring or dissenting authors recorded
    \item Approximately 3\% of cases have opinion and either concurring or dissenting (not both) authors recorded
    \item Approximately 1\% of cases have opinion, concurring, and dissenting authors recorded

\subsection{Distribution of opinion, concurring, and dissenting authors by court and year}

Figure \ref{fig:distOpinionTypeCourtYear} compares case frequency by data set, court, year, and author type combination (o=opinion, c=concurring, d=dissenting).  Gray vertical lines separate pairs of bars, one pair for each year, the left bar indicating data set A case frequency, the right bar indicating data set B frequency.  Stacked regions within bars are color coded by author type combination and indicate associated case frequencies.\\

Observations:

\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{1pt}
    \item Cases with decision dates in 1973 appear to be absent in data set A
    \item The frequency of 2018 cases in data set B appears significantly greater than that in data set A, especially for the 9th Circuit
    \item Slight differences, between sets B and A, in case frequency are apparent for certain courts, years, and author type
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item 2nd Circuit, 2016 and 2017:  decrease in o-- cases (opinion with no concurring or dissenting authors) with slight increase in --- cases (no opinions)
      \item 3rd Circuit, 2017:  increase in o-- and --- cases
      \item 5th Circuit
      \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item 2011:  increase in o-- cases with corresponding decrease in --- cases
        \item 2013:  decrease in o-- cases with corresponding increase in -c- cases
        \item 2015:  increase in o-- cases with corresponding decrease in -c- cases
        \item 2016:  increase in --- cases
        \item 2017:  increase in -c- and --- cases
      \end{itemize}
      \item 6th Circuit, 2011-2017:  increase in --- cases
      \item 7th Circuit, 2014, 2016, 2017:  increase in --- cases
      \item 8th Circuit, 2017:  increase in --- cases
      \item 9th Circuit, 2016-2017:  increase in --- cases
      \item 9th Circuit, 2017:  increase in -c- cases
      \item 10th Circuit, 2017:  increase in --- cases and possible increase in -cd cases
      \item 11th Circuit, 2015-2017:  increase in --- cases
      \item 11th Circuit, 2017:  increase in -c- cases
      \item Federal Circuit, 2017:  increase in -c- cases
    \end{itemize}
    \item All discernible differences appear in years 1973 and 2011-2018
    \item Above patterns of increase in frequency are consistent those observed in figure \ref{fig:diffCasesCourtYear}.

\subsection{Comparison of data sets A and B opinion, concurring, and dissenting author types by case}

Two cases, of 1,083,552 appearing in both data sets A and B, exhibit a difference in opinion author types between sets.  These appear in table \ref{tab:diffCaseOpinionAuthType}.  All other cases appearing in both data sets have identical opinion, concurring, and dissenting author type combinations in both sets.

\subsection{Comparison of data sets A and B opinion, concurring, and dissenting author IDs and names by case}

As seen in table \ref{tab:exampleOpinionJudge}, various methods of identifying authors are employed in both data sets.  After removal of ``urn:entity:" from and conversion of ``\textasciitilde\textasciitilde" to ``\textasciitilde" in author fields, 33,753 cases, of 1,083,564 appearing in both data sets, have unequal entries in author fields.  Differences are typically due to a judge ID appearing in an author field of one data set but not the other.  Examples of differing authors, by case, appear in table \ref{tab:exampleDiffAuthor}.  Although clear, visual associations are apparent in set A and set B judge identifier text, a question arises regarding changes in LN's data extraction methods that cause observed differences.  Is one method preferred?  Do observed differences raise the possibility of differences in other fields that are not observed?

\section{Evaluation of case outcome}

Case outcome type is assigned by the SQL import algorithm using the following classification rules (the first rule satisfied assigns outcome type):\\

If outcome contains ``reversed" then outcome type = reversed\\
Else if outcome contains ``vacated" then outcome type = vacated\\
Else if outcome contains ``affirmed" then outcome type = affirmed\\
Else if outcome contains ``denied" then outcome type = denied\\
Else outcome type = other\\

Table \ref{tab:distOutcomeType} shows the distribution of cases by outcome type.  Of the 649,399 and 677,892 cases in data sets A and B, respectively, having an outcome type of ``Other," 623,492 and 651,314, respectively, have empty outcome text.  Another 12,676 and 12,915, respectively, contain the text ``dismiss."   Perhaps the classification rules could be amended to include one for ``Dismissed" cases.  Table \ref{tab:otherNonEmptuOutcome} lists example outcome text for cases with outcome type classification of ``Other" and not containing the text ``dismiss."  One case appearing in both data sets has outcome text that is different between sets:  5PDP-0CD1-F04K-X0N0-00000-00 (11th Circuit, 2017-09-06, Sears v. Hardin), with empty outcome text in data set A and outcome text ``Affirmed" in data set B.

\subsection{Distribution of cases by outcome type and year}

Figure \ref{fig:distOutcomeTypeYear} shows the distribution of cases by outcome type, year, and data set.  Since only one case appearing in both data sets has different outcome text between sets, discrepancies in case frequencies between data sets (primarily in 1973 and 2016-2018) is due to case additions in data set B.

\section{Evaluation of publication status}

Each case record has publication status of either ``Reported" or ``Unreported."  Table \ref{tab:distPubStat} lists the distribution of cases by data set and status.  Table \ref{tab:changePubStat} lists the number of cases, by year of decision date in data set A, that have different publication status values in the two data sets.  Note that cases with (set A) decision dates in years 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1981 have consistent status values in both data sets.  Data set A contains no cases with a decision date in 1973.\\[-6pt]

\section{Distribution of publication status by court and year}

Figure \ref{fig:distPubStatCourtYear} plots the proportion of reported cases by court, year and data set.  For most courts and years, proportions are approximately equal between data sets.  Observed differences may be due to the composition of cases added to set B for years 1973 and 2016-2018.  Note that for certain courts and years, set B proportion reported is greater than that of set A (2nd Circuit, 2018; 3rd Circuit, 2018; and Temp Emergency, 1974), while for other courts and years, set B proportion reported is less than that of set A (1st Circuit, 2018; 6th Circuit, 2016; 11th Circuit, 2018).

\section{Evaluation of per curiam indicator}

Each case record has per curiam indicator of either True or False.  Table \ref{tab:distPerCuriam} lists the distribution of cases by data set and per curiam indicator.  No cases appearing on both data sets A and B have different per curiam indicators between data sets.  Figure \ref{fig:distPerCuriamCourtYear} plots the proportion of per curiam cases by court, year and data set.  For most courts and years, proportions are approximately equal between data sets.  Observed differences may be due to the composition of cases added to set B for years 1973 and 2016-2018.
