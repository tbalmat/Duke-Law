The following resulted from the requirement of surrounding column three of the Citations records since some entries had commas
However some entries also had double quotes, so that forcing quotes caused double quotes within double quotes
Converting original double quotes with exclamation points resolved the following errors
A request was made to LexisNexis that they surround column three with double quotes in their source records
Resulting records must be checked for proper quoting (to verify that they treated the original quotes correctly)
