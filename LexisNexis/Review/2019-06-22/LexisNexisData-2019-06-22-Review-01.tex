\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item  Decrease in case incidence through study period

    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item The total number of cases in the data for 1996 was 44,659. Between 1996 and 2004, the data have a fairly steadily decreasing number of cases, to a low of 27,379 in 2004. The LN client on the Web has similar numbers. The decrease seems to be associate with occurrence of cases that have no classification (neither civil nor criminal). A review of caseload data for those years on the Administrative Office of the US Courts website indicates that there was no decrease in case load at either the district court or the appellate court level during this time period. The Westlaw database indicates no decrease, either.
        
        \item Questions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What causes a case to be without classification (civil or criminal)?
            \item Was there a change in the type of cases included in the United States Courts of Appeals database that started to take effect around 1996?
            \item Are there separate databases (for example, Bankruptcy Courts or Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims) that were created around this time that include cases that were formerly included within the United States Courts of Appeals database?
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Figures \ref{fg:YearCaseTypeDensity} and \ref{fg:CourtYearCaseLineGraph} show the distribution of cases in the supplied data by case type, court, and year.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Panel size
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Figures \ref{fg:PanelSizeDistribution} and \ref{fg:PanelSizeCourtLineGraph} show the distribution of cases by panel size in aggregate and by court.  A problem of empty panel (zero judges) and two judge panels is clearly visible.  Example cases with missing panel are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 3XNJ-6V30-0038-X1MH-00000-00, Wilder v. United States, 182 F.3d 934, 1999-04-29
            \item 3S4X-D540-003B-5011-00000-00, Carter v. Lack, 869 F.2d 1489, 1989-02-13
            \item 3S4X-3S60-003B-G10W-00000-00, Silverman v. Hannah Inland Waterways, 671 F.2d 1376, 1982-03-04
            \item 3S4X-2NB0-001B-K4DV-00000-00, U.S. v. Bridger, 845 F.2d 1027, 1988-02-22
            \item 3S4X-BT70-003B-P36H-00000-00, Saephanh v. Shalala, 9 F.3d 1553, 1993-10-28
            \item 3S4X-38D0-003B-P171-00000-00, Cooley v. Whitley, 35 F.3d 560, 1994-08-25
            \item 4G0T-GYC0-0038-X427-00000-00, Drain v. Rumsfeld, 126 Fed. Appx. 463, 2004-12-14
            \item 3S4X-4C00-008H-V500-00000-00, UNITED STATES v. RHYMES, 960 F.2d 153, 1992-04-16
            \item 3S4X-FY40-001T-D4P0-00000-00, Levy v. Lerner, 52 F.3d 312, 1995-03-31
            \item 3S4X-5XK0-008H-V329-00000-00, United States v. Brown, 953 F.2d 640, 1992-02-03
            \item 4J3X-M570-TVSH-535T-00000-00, Mogyorossy v. Dep't of the Air Force, 161 Fed. Appx. 956, 2006-01-12
        \end{itemize}

        \item An attempt was made to identify, for each case record with missing panel, a separate case record for the same case, but one with a panel.  To accomplish this, the reporter was removed from case titles, all title text was converted to lower case, and abbreviations were standardized (``u.s." to "united states", ``co." to ``company", etc.).  38\% of cases with missing panel were found to be duplicated by a case record with panel.
        
        \item Following are examples, from the 9th Circuit on 5-13-1988, of apparent duplicate cases, each pair having one record with and one without a panel
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Friedman v. United States (1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 22018, with panel; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 6749, no panel)
            \item United States v. Crabtree (1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 22076, with panel; United States v. Crabtree, 846 F.2d 1383, no panel)
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Figure \ref{fg:NoPanelDist-nCases-By-CourtYear} plots the distribution (count) of cases with no panel in the LN data, by court and year.  The solid line represents all cases that have no panel.  The dashed line is limited to cases with no panel, but with a matching case (court, date, title) that does have a panel.  In addition to the appearance of spikes by court and year, many non-panel cases for court IDs 1, 4, 8, and 10 appear to have matching cases with a panel.  Court IDs and names appear in table \ref{tb:CourtID01}.
        
        \item Figure \ref{fg:NoPanelDist-ProportionCases-By-CourtYear} plots cases with missing panel as a proportion of total cases by court and year.  The similarity of total missing panel and duplicated with panel lines for court IDs 1, 4, 8, and 10 is seen here as in figure \ref{fg:NoPanelDist-nCases-By-CourtYear}.  For all courts, the proportion of cases with no panel, but duplicated with panel, is near zero prior to approximately 1990.
        
        \item Cases with difference in panel size when compared to LN on-line or Westlaw
              
        \item A random sample of two hundred cases was examined for panel size. Many cases occurring with a panel of size other than three are reported on-line as having a three judge panel. Following are examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Missing judges
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 1975; 3S4X-3RD0-0039-M292-00000-00 Wolf v. Jane Phillips Episcopal-Memorial Medical Center 
                (Only Seth appears in the data, missing Judge Lewis and McWilliams)
                
                \item 1991; 3S4X-BPJ0-008H-V351-00000-00 Love v. Love 
                (Only Brorby appears in the data, missing Judge Anderson and Tacha)
                
                \item 1979; 3S4W-WJ90-0039-M01F-00000-00 St. Regis Paper Co. v. Marshall 
                (Only Seth appears in the data, missing Judge Lewis and McWilliams)
                
                \item 1998; 3S3D-VVD0-0038-X18P-00000-00 Brown v. Gome 
                (Only Leavy and Canby appear, missing Pregerson)
                
                \item 1990; 3S4X-1NY0-003B-51X8-00000-00 Pledger v. Frank
                (Only Russell and Butzner appear, missing Phillips)
                
                \item The list goes on. For the majority of these cases, it seems that missing judges do not have hyperlinks.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item One hundred and ten cases of one hundred and fifteen sampled, having two judge panels in the data, were found to have three in on-line references. 
    
        \item Redundant judges
        \begin{itemize}            
            \item Judge of different court level included in the panel
            \begin{itemize} 
                \item 1987; 3S4X-BKC0-001B-K27G-00000-00 Richard A. Plehn, Inc. v. Gould 
                (Hilton and Merhige, district court judges prior to appeal, included in the panel in addition to the three judges)
                
                \item 1988; 3S4W-YDM0-001B-K27K-00000-00 MARTIN v. UNITED STATES
                (Scalia, the Supreme court judge, is included in the panel when Scalia appears in the opinion text as reference)
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item One judge counted multiple times
            \begin{itemize} 
                \item 1989; 3S4X-C640-003B-555C-00000-00 Vaccaro v. Stephens 
                (Herbert Y.C. Choy appears twice as Herbert Y.C. Choy and Herbert Young Cho Choy)
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item One judge leads to multiple judges with the same last name
            \begin{itemize}                     
                \item 1985; 3S4X-JKR0-0039-P50D-00000-00 Weems v. Ball Metal \& Chemical Div., Inc.
                (Bailey Brown and Jones Brown both included in the panel. Only “Brown” shows up in LN search result. The hyperlink to “Brown” leads to Bailey Brown, suggesting that Jones Brown may be added by mistake)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Observations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first and last names of judges appear in the supplied data while, typically, only the last name appears in LN on-line hyperlinks
            \item Judges who are missing in panels tend to have missing hyperlinks on-line
            \item District court judges tend to appear in panels
            \item Panels may repeat a single judge
            \item A judge may appear in a panel reported within the supplied data, but does not appear in the on-line record of the panel
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item Comment:  Perhaps LexisNexis created panels in the supplied dataset by using the last name of judges as reported in their web data and matching them to a judge database for more information, such as complete names. This would explain why judges without on-line hyperlinks are missing in dataset panels, since they are likely to have not been linked to their judge database. It would also explain why judges of different court level (either in the prior history or opinion sections) appear in panels. However, it does not explain how a judge with hyperlink leads to two different judges (e.g. in one of the cases, searching for ``Brown" results in two judges in the data - Bailey Brown and Jones Brown, while the ``Brown" hyperlink is linked to Bailey Brown). Perhaps LN's method of establishing the names of judges in panels and identifying exact records within their judge database results in selection of multiple judges, leading to four judge panels, when the correct number is three. 

    \end{itemize}

    \item Missing legal topics.  Over 600,000 cases have no legal topics.  Table \ref{tb:MissingTopicSample} contains a random sample of 100 cases from those that are missing legal topics.
    
    \item Legal topic definitions.  LN is conducting a review of our request to provide complete text of legal topics.

    \item Missing Shepard's treatments (examples)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case: 3S4X-64W0-001B-K0KB-00000-00; Bouchillon v. Collins, 907 F.2d 589\\
        Citation: LN client lists two ``criticizing" cases that do not appear in the data (Phillips v. Lane, 787 F.2d 208 and Brown v. Warden, Great Meadow Correctional Facility, 682 F.2d 348).
        
        \item Case: 3S4X-JWW0-003B-H2GP-00000-00; Exxon Co. v. Sofec, Inc., 54 F.3d 570\\
        Citation:  LN Client lists Grace Line, Inc. v. Todd Shipyards Corp., 500 F.2d 361, 366 (9th Cir. 1974) as ``distinguished," which seems correct, but is not included in the data.
        
        \item Case: 3S4X-6TM0-0039-N3J9-00000-00; United States v. Nunez-Aguilar, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 8537\\
        Citation: LN client shows United States v. Medina-Gasca, 739 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir. 1984), as criticized, but is not included in the data.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Obsolete treatment codes.  Several treatment codes used in citations within the supplied data are labeled as ``obsolete" in the supplied treatment definition table.  The are \&qab, \&qabp, *c, *d, *e, *f, *o, *q, ab,  abp, cf, Ltd, mi, pd, pg, qab, qabp, qr, qv, qw.  For each ``qr" and ``qv" citation, a corresponding ``q" citation was serched for as a possible replacement.  None were found.  Should citations with ``obsolete" treatments be ignored?
    
    \item Authoring judge IDs.  IDs for authoring (opinion, concurring, and dissenting) judges are required.  Note that a similar request was made for panel judges, and they were supplied.
    
    \item Missing court.  Forty cases are missing a court identifier (they follow).  The court for each can be determined using LN on-line, indicating that LN possesses this information and that there exists some flaw in the query that generated the supplied data.  Ideally, the error would be corrected, as opposed to our backfilling from data they possess.  Often, missing data are merely a symptom of flawed query logic and correction of the logic may resolve not only the apparent error, but also others that remain, lurking, to be identified later.\\\\

    \item Judge names.  Twenty judges are missing a name (they follow).  Although none appear in panels at present, they may appear once the missing panel issue is resolved.  Also, as stated, missing data can be caused by flaws in query logic.  Ideally, the root cause of apparent data errors should be corrected.\\\\
